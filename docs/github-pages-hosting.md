## ü§î What is Web Hosting?

**Web hosting** is the process of making your websites available anywhere on the Internet. It allows people from Cuba, America, or anywhere in the world to access your website 24/7.

### How Web Hosting Works

To make your website available globally, you need to:

1. **Upload your files** (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) to a **web server**
2. **Connect to the Internet** - The web server must be connected to the Internet 24/7
3. **Make it accessible** - Anyone can now access your files from anywhere in the world

### Web Server vs. Local Computer

| Local Development | Web Hosting |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Files stored on your computer | Files stored on a web server |
| Only you can access the website | Anyone can access the website |
| Available only when your computer is on | Available 24/7 |
| No Internet connection required | Requires Internet connection |

---

## üíª Local vs. Web Development

### Local Development
- **What it is**: All files and folders are stored locally on your computer
- **Access**: Only you can view the website by opening files directly
- **Sharing**: You'd need to physically copy files or send zip files to others
- **URL**: File paths like `file:///Users/yourname/website/index.html`

### Web Development (Hosted)
- **What it is**: Files are uploaded to a web server connected to the Internet
- **Access**: Anyone with the URL can view your website
- **Sharing**: Simply share the web URL with anyone
- **URL**: Web addresses like `https://yourusername.github.io/your-repository`

## üöÄ Setting Up GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages is a free web hosting service provided by GitHub that allows you to host static websites directly from your GitHub repositories.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:
- ‚úÖ A completed HTML website project
- ‚úÖ All necessary files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images)
- ‚úÖ An `index.html` file as your homepage
- ‚úÖ A GitHub account (free)

---

## üìã Step-by-Step Hosting Process

### Step 1: Create a GitHub Account

2. Click **"Sign up"** if you don't have an account
3. If you already have an account, click **"Sign in"**
4. Complete the registration process

### Step 2: Create a New Repository

1. Once logged in, look for the **"+"** icon in the top-right corner
2. Click the dropdown and select **"New repository"**
3. Fill out the repository details:

   ```
   Repository name: html-portfolio
   Description: My personal portfolio website (optional)
   Visibility: Public ‚úÖ (Required for free GitHub Pages)
   Initialize: ‚úÖ Add a README file
   ```

4. Click **"Create repository"**

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: The repository must be **public** for GitHub Pages to work with free accounts.

### Step 3: Upload Your Website Files

1. In your new repository, click the **"Add file"** dropdown
2. Select **"Upload files"**
3. Navigate to your HTML portfolio project folder on your computer
4. **Drag and drop** the **contents** of your project folder (not the folder itself)

   ```
   ‚úÖ Correct: Drag individual files
   index.html
   style.css
   images/
   public/
   
   ‚ùå Incorrect: Drag the entire project folder
   my-portfolio-folder/
   ```

5. Ensure your files include:
   - `index.html` (your homepage - **must be named exactly this**)
   - CSS files
   - JavaScript files
   - Images folder
   - Any other HTML pages

6. Add a commit message (e.g., "Upload portfolio website files")
7. Click **"Commit changes"**

### Step 4: Verify File Upload

After the upload completes (may take a few minutes):

1. **Refresh the page** if needed
2. **Verify all files** are listed in your repository
3. **Check that `index.html`** is present and correctly named
4. If files are missing, repeat the upload process

### Step 5: Enable GitHub Pages

1. In your repository, click on **"Settings"** (top navigation)
2. Scroll down to **"Pages"** in the left sidebar
3. Under **"Source"**, change from **"None"** to **"Deploy from a branch"**
4. Select **"main"** branch
5. Select **"/ (root)"** folder
6. Click **"Save"**

### Step 6: Access Your Live Website

1. **Wait 1-10 minutes** for GitHub to process your site
2. **Refresh the Pages settings page** periodically
3. Look for a green checkmark and message: **"Your site is live at [URL]"**
4. Click **"Visit site"** to view your live website

## üîß Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: "404 - File not found" Error

**Cause**: Your main HTML file is not named `index.html`

**Solution**:
```
‚úÖ Correct filename: index.html
‚ùå Incorrect: home.html, main.html, portfolio.html
```

### Issue 2: "No server is currently available"

**Cause**: GitHub is processing your site or experiencing high traffic

**Solutions**:
- Wait 5-10 minutes and try again
- Refresh the page multiple times
- Check GitHub's status page for service issues

### Issue 3: Changes Not Appearing

**Cause**: Browser caching or GitHub needs time to update

**Solutions**:
- Hard refresh your browser (`Ctrl+F5` or `Cmd+Shift+R`)
- Wait a few minutes for GitHub to update
- Clear your browser cache

### Issue 4: Images Not Loading

**Cause**: Incorrect file paths or case sensitivity

**Solutions**:
- Check that image files are uploaded
- Verify file paths in your HTML
- Ensure consistent case (e.g., `image.jpg` not `Image.JPG`)

### Issue 5: CSS/JavaScript Not Working

**Cause**: Incorrect file paths or missing files

**Solutions**:
- Verify all CSS and JS files are uploaded
- Check file paths in your HTML `<link>` and `<script>` tags
- Use relative paths (e.g., `./style.css` not `C:/Users/...`)

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### File Organization

```
your-repository/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html          # Homepage (required)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ about.html          # Additional pages
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ contact.html
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ css/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ style.css       # Stylesheets
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ js/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ script.js       # JavaScript files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ images/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ profile.jpg     # Image assets
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ background.png
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md           # Project documentation
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Use lowercase** for all file and folder names
- **Use hyphens** instead of spaces (`about-me.html` not `about me.html`)
- **Be consistent** with file extensions (`.html`, `.css`, `.js`)
- **Keep names descriptive** but concise

### Performance Tips

- **Optimize images** - Compress images to reduce load times
- **Minimize CSS/JS** - Remove unnecessary code
- **Use relative paths** - Ensure portability across environments
- **Test locally first** - Always test your website locally before uploading

4. GitHub will automatically enable HTTPS

### Repository Settings

```yaml
# _config.yml (optional Jekyll configuration)

```

### Branch Configuration

- **Main branch**: Use for production-ready code

### Analytics and SEO

Add to your `index.html`:

```html
<!-- Google Analytics (optional) -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=GA_TRACKING_ID"></script>

<!-- SEO Meta Tags -->
<meta name="description" content="Your website description">
